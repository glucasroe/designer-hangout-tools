#Designer Hangout Tools:

A list of tools shared in the resources_tools channel from the [UX Designer Hangout](http://www.designerhangout.co/). At some future point, I'm hoping to make this a more robust tool, but for now it's a markdown document. Try to contain your excitement.

#The List:

##UX tools:
* ### Prototyping:
  * [Principle](http://principleformac.com/) *Shared by many people*
    
    The general consensus is that Principle is a tool for *interaction design*. It has robust and intuitive animation features, and some nice things like interoperability with Sketch.
    
    **Pros**: Fast, simple to setup, varied outputs
    
    **Cons**: Mac only, difficult to create much beyond a single app flow
