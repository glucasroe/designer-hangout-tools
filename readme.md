#Designer Hangout Tools:

A list of tools shared in the resources_tools channel from the [UX Designer Hangout](http://www.designerhangout.co/). At some future point, I'm hoping to make this a more robust tool, but for now jus the text will have to do.

##Contributing to this list:
There are 2 ways to contribute to this list:

1. Edit this markdown file and submit a pull request
2. Post it in the resources_tools channel and I'll add it if I think it's interesting.
